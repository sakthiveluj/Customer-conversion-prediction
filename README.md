# Customer-conversion-prediction


The goal of the Customer Conversion Prediction project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a client will subscribe to the insurance based on their demographic and marketing data. The project aims to help the insurance company identify the customers that are most likely to convert, so that they can be targeted via call and the cost of telephonic marketing campaigns can be reduced. The historical sales data provided will be used to train and evaluate the performance of the machine learning models. The analysis of the model will be done to identify the important factors that contribute towards the conversion and the AUROC metric will be used to evaluate the model's performance.Customer Conversion Prediction project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a client will subscribe to the insurance based on their demographic and marketing data.
